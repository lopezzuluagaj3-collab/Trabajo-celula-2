MiniOS

MiniOS is a project where we create a “mini operating system” using only HTML and CSS. We don’t use JavaScript, so everything works in a very simple way.

In this project, you have a main page (index.html) that shows different “applications” inside an iframe (a small window where another page is loaded). The user can switch between applications using a menu made with HTML.

What can you do in MiniOS? View a main page that looks like an operating system. Switch between different applications (like Notes, Tasks, or Weather). Everything is displayed inside an iframe. Navigate without any JavaScript, only using HTML.

What is each part? index.html: here you see the main interface of MiniOS. apps/: contains the different applications, each one is an HTML file. styles/: contains the CSS file to style MiniOS.
